          <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
          <p>I am a hobbyist who has enjoyed coding for over several years and have gained familiarity programming in several languages and technologies.</p>
          <p>Presently, I am pursing a greater understanding of Javascript <strong>MEAN</strong> development using MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. Within six months, I want to build a compelling portfolio for several potential employers
             who are offering junior position job opportunities within mid-size tech firms. </p>
             <p>This is huge opportunity for me as it may lead to a fulfilling career change from business operations to front-end development.</p>
